## Script Kiddie

This is a Laravel application that meet the following requirements:

- Certain routes can only be accessed by authenticated users

- To become a user that can authenticate himself, users should be registered somehow (either by letting the users register themselves or otherwise)

- On login, users must have the option to keep the user authenticated indefinitely (or until they manually logout)
